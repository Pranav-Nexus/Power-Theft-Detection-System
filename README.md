# Power-Theft-Detection-System
A System using Arduino's to detect theft of electricity from the Grid.

Power theft in countries like India, and much of the other developing part of the world is 
a major issue and one which the government and utilities are trying to combat for the past 
several decades.
The thieving of electricity is not just confined to rural and semi â€“ urban parts but is more 
rampant in cities, especially metropolitan cities

Electricity is counted among the essentials for life among air, food and water in modern 
times and access to this resource is necessary for the upliftment of society, improving the 
quality of life, increasing the quality of healthcare and for the growth of our civilization.
Hence, the access to this resource must be at a fair and equitable price for all.
Theft of electricity deprives the grid and hence the consumer of this necessary resource, 
thereby artificially and unethically reducing the available supply in the grid and hence 
inflating the cost for all.
